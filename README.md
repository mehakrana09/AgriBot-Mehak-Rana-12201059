# ðŸŒ¾ AgriBot - Smart Agriculture Assistant

BY MEHAK RANA

## Project Overview
AgriBot is an intelligent agriculture recommendation system that helps farmers make informed decisions about crop selection and fertilizer application based on soil conditions, weather data, and location information.

---

## Problem Statement
Farmers often struggle to choose the right crop and fertilizer due to limited knowledge of their soilâ€™s condition and lack of expert guidance. This leads to poor yield and inefficient use of resources. There is a need for a system that can analyze soil data and provide accurate, location-specific recommendations to support better agricultural decisions.

---

## Solution Summary
This project is an AI-powered agriculture chatbot that recommends the best crop and suitable fertilizer based on soil data (pH, nutrients, moisture, etc.) of a specific area. It helps farmers make data-driven decisions to improve yield and optimize soil health.

## Features
- End-to-end working web app (accessible via browser)
- Implements ML Model for crop and fertilizarion recommendation
- Clean UI and stable performance
- Real-world applicability
- Clear, maintainable code structure

---

## ðŸ§© Technical Architecture
> - Frontend sends query of different parameters such as (N, K, moisture etc) â†’ Backend API (FastAPI)
> - Backend fetches and passes these value to the function in the form of payload where ML model is set up.
> - The ML model takes these inputs and predict the output
> - Sends the output generated by the model to the frontend
> - Response displayed in web interface
